## 📝 Executive Summary
**Project Objective:** Can we predict and reduce US flight delays through systemic data engineering?  
This repository hosts a high-fidelity **Aviation ETL Pipeline** and **Strategic Ops Dashboard**. By analyzing 5.8M rows of Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) data, we identify carrier bottlenecks, seasonal delay profiles, and operational interventions to improve on-time performance.

## 🏗 Industrial Data Architecture
The pipeline is designed for horizontal scalability and reproducibility.

## 🚀 Quick Start (One-Click Pipeline)
1.  **Clone the Repo**: `git clone https://github.com/adamyatiwari12/SectionD_G19_FlightOps-Dashboard.git`
2.  **Run ETL**: `python3 scripts/etl_pipeline.py` (Converts raw CSVs to cleaned assets).
3.  **Prepare for BI**: `python3 scripts/tableau_prep.py` (Generates aggregated Tableau CSVs).

---

## 📊 Standard KPI Framework
*   **OTP (On-Time Performance)**: Arrival Delay ≤ 15 minutes.
*   **D-Delay & A-Delay**: Variance between departure and arrival timelines.
*   **Cancellation Tiers**: Root-cause categorization (Carrier, Weather, NAS, Security).
